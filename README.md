# 💱 Currency Converter in Java

Welcome! This is a hands-on project developed as part of the Java Backend course at Alura Latam. The goal is to help you apply fundamental concepts of Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and API consumption in a real-world context.

## 🧑‍🏫 Project Context

Hi, my name is Génesys Rondón and I'll be your guide on this learning journey. This currency converter is a great opportunity to reinforce what you've learned in your initial Java training. The idea is to work with a console-based application that:

- Displays a menu with multiple currency conversion options.
- Prompts the user to enter a value to convert.
- Queries an external API to get the current exchange rate.
- Returns the result to the user in a clear format.
- Allows repeated conversions in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
